We base all of our formulas on proven scientific research that obey the laws of nature. We have NO intention of letting that principle be corrupted. </inline>

    <inline style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Most supplement companies promote synthetic vitamins and ingredients that have "drug-like" side effects. The OHS formulas are whole food-based, utilizing whole food vitamins, patented chelated (organic) minerals, pure plant enzymes and stabilized probiotics. Our formulators work in office, and have created and developed hundreds of products throughout the years. You can take comfort in knowing the products you're taking are based on sound nutritional research. <br/><br/>Our formulas address everything from daily nutritional needs to therapeutic levels of nutrients that the body may need to increase performance (such as internal cleaning, losing body fat, and gaining muscle) or even recovering from a specific condition. <br/><br/></inline>

        <inline style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The health care system today promotes drugs and surgeries as the answer to our health problems, but nothing could be farther from the truth. Drugs and surgeries are for crisis care—and the pharmaceutical companies and surgeons are great at helping with crisis care situations.</inline>

They want the best with no compromise. We understand, as does the U.S. Surgeon General, that most diseases, low energy levels, and premature aging come from not obeying simple laws of nature when it comes to lifestyle choices.</inline>

We promote and sell nutritional programs in booklet and video form. We have <em>Edumails </em>and <em>Special Health Reports</em> containing up-to-date research and information that explains how you can change a few habits and food choices to improve your health dramatically. We promote proven exercise programs. We sell only the highest grade of whole food nutrients proven by research to help nutritionally support the body—and we help you determine the amounts you need.</inline>
